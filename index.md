# Scovillains
A fun and spicy game to play with friends or family who love hot sauce.

## Overview

Compete for points across a series of randomly-selected minigames as you sample increasingly spicy hot sauces.

Before play, the players select the order of hot sauces, arranged from mild to hottest. The recommended way to partake of the sauces is by preparing food featuring them, such as chicken wings; or by dipping something like a tortilla chip or french fry into a tiny dollop. Each hot sauce is a "round."

Each round, the next player will roll a die to determine the the minigame everyone must play that round. During the round, each player will take a bite of the hot sauce, and then attempt to complete the minigame.

If a player is unable to unwilling to complete a minigame, the other players will roll the die to select a punishment to apply to the offending player, in exchange for keeping them in the game. If the punishment is not accepted, that player is OUT.

## Minigames

Roll a 10- or 20-sided die (or select your six favorite minigames and roll a regular 6-sided die, you normie). The minigames are as follows:

1. Trivia
1. Sing-Along
1. Explain that 'Gram
1. Truth or Dare
1. Would You Rather
1. Charades
1. Scenes from a Hat
1. Riddles in the Dark
1. Blackjack
1. Double Trouble

### Trivia

Each player rolls the die again to determine a trivia category:

1. Sports and Games
1. TV and Film
1. Science
1. Art and Literature
1. History and Geography

( If you're using a 10-sided die, then 1-2 is _Sports and Games_, 3-4 is _TV and Film_, and so on. If you're using a 6-sided die, then add a _Player's Choice_ category for a roll of 6. Don't overthink this. )

Another player will Google an appropriately-challenging trivia question. If the rolling player gets the question right, the earn a point. If they get the question wrong, it's punishment time!

### Sing-Along

Each player calls out a Disney or traditional folk song, and rolls the die. The first time the die lands on 1, the song is chosen for the round. All players must sing along to a video with lyrics for the song's entire duration to the best of their ability. 
The only way to lose is to pause for a drink or flat out refuse... In which case, it's punishment time! Otherwise, all participating players earn a point. 

### Explain that 'Gram

Each player must open the social media photo collection of their choice on their phone, and pass it to the person on the left, who must then select an image that the owner must explain to the group's satisfaction. This is perhaps the easiest task, except for people who don't or won't share social media photos with the group - they must suffer the punishment. Everyone else picks up a point after their turn. 

### Truth or Dare

Each person writes down a question and dare on a sticky note or paper scrap and puts it in a pile. 
From oldest to youngest, each player draws an item from the pile at random, and may opt to either answer the question honestly or perform the dare.
Refusals, failures, and liars earn punishment; everyone else earns a point. 

### Would You Rather

Each person writes down a "would you rather" scenario on a sticky note or paper scrap and puts in in a pile.
For example, "Would you rather fight a horse sized duck or a duck sized horse?" 
From youngest to oldest, each player draws an item from the pile at random, and must answer the question with a straight face and without laughing. 
Any player who refuses, laughs, breaks face, or can't answer in a reasonable amount of time must suffer a punishment. Every other player earns a point. 

### Charades

The players split into two teams and the group plays a quick round of charades. 
Simply, the winning team's players each earn a point, and the losing team's players each earn a punishment. 

### Scenes from a Hat

Each person writes down an improv scenario, eg, "Mickey Mouse tries to rob a bank," and puts it in a pile. 
In alphabetical first name order, each player takes an item at random from the pile and acts out the scene. 
If the group is satisfied, then the player earns a point. If the group is unanimously unimpressed, or the player refuses, the player must take a punishment. 

### Riddles in the Dark

Simple - each player is given a hastily Googled riddle by the player on their left. If they answer correctly, they score a point. If they get it wrong, they suffer a punishment. 

### Blackjack

Whoever rolls highest gets to be dealer (and must follow Vegas dealer rules.) 
The group then plays 1 round of Vegas blackjack. 
Any player busting or failing to beat the dealer gets a punishment. 
The dealer gets a punishment if they bust or are beaten by any player. 
Anyone who actually scores 21 with a black jack gets 2 points, oooooh! 
Anyone else wins 1 point. 

### Double Trouble

This round is now worth double points, and double punishments. 
And whomever rolled gets to choose the minigame. 
And replace one item on the punishment list with a custom punishment of their own choosing.
